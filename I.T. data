Gaming has been the main influence on my interest in I.T., from my early days of an Atari 2600 to my current Xbox one it has scoped my interest in technology.
Past study included a part completion of a Bachelour degree in Computer Science at JCU. C++ was a struggle and I found this part of the degree boring and monotonous.
RMIT was a university that offered subjects while doing my Logistics Degree through Open Universitys Australia.
This subject is a final elective required to finish my degree after 8 years of part time study while working full time as an Inventory Controller in a large distribution center.
